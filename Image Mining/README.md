# Image Mining

This work comprises two of the practical assignments I completed for a course on Image Mining.

For lab exercise 1, there was no substantial coding so I decided to leave it out here.

For lab 2, the goal was to train a Convolutional Neural Network on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. I tried multiple different architectures and hyperparameters to see what their impact on the performance is.

For lab 3, the goal was to develop an object tracker. Both the Mean Shift algorithm and tracking using the Hough Transform were used.
