# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing
This work comprises two of the practical assignments I completed for a course on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. 

The goal of the first lab was to build a 'simple' Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) model on IMDb reviews and classify them as positive or negative based on the words in the review.

The goal of the second lab was to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the same dataset. We were not allowed to use the Convolution layers provided by PyTorch, but the sliding window function had to be written using the linear layers in PyTorch.

PyTorch was used for these assignments.
