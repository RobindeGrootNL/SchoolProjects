# Deep Learning

This work comprises three of the practical assignments I completed for a course on Deep Learning.

The first lab was an exercise on making simple a Neural Network (NN) using only numpy. This way we learned more about the functionality of libraries like PyTorch.

The second lab improved on the first by implementing auto-diff and building a larger NN.

The third lab consists of two parts. The goal of the first part was to train a NN on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. Multiple architectures were tested. The goal of the second part was to build a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) using PyTorch to construct new MNIST examples based on the MNIST training set.

NumPy and PyTorch were used for these assignments.
